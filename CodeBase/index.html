            <b>Hello lucky one!</b> Welcome to my ******** website.
            <BR>
            What the reader must understand from the get go is that this site is only written while intoxicated
        <p>
        <p>
            There's a time and place for <strong>everything</strong><br>
            And during my wandering years I have accumulated and acquired a skillset which no one else has.
            And I am most certain that others has done the same.
            <br>
            <i>No one</i> is equal, everyone is <i>'special'</i><div class="Main-Content-Wrapping_question">..are you?</div>


        </p>
        <p>
            To understand who StupidO is and why you have come to this place you must ask yourself a few questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Is there something you are searching for</li>
                <li>Is there something you need</li>
                <li>Did you stumble or was directed here</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can add one of the three lines above as true. Mark which one(s) and push the button!
        </p>
